# AICup2023-No-Flask



## Overview

This is a fork of [AICup2023](https://github.com/AI-Cup-Kernel) That prepared for Reinforcement Learning or learn with
Genetic Algorithm. I remove all flask dependencies to make a complete game round faster
and easy to develop RL algorithms.

## How to run

- [ ] Simply run `main.py` for the whole game running:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
- [ ] You can change clients code on 'clients' folder
    ```
    ls /clients/
    - > client_ai.py (write you'r algorithm here)
    - > client_enemy.py (write you'r enemy algorithm here)
    - > game_client.py (you don't need to change this file)
    ```
    As you know we have two methods (`initializer_turn` & `turn`) on each client for two
    main phases of the game.
